        <p style="color:black">My father-in-law sends us lobsters,
            since we are close by and he has several for us to cook.
            The catch is that even if you can catch a really great one,
            theyâ€™re still a bit unpredictable. Lobsters are important because 
            they supply food. One reason lobstermen started voting for a change
            in the river in 2013 was to attract more tourist boats because
            the presence of tourists draws other anglers. Lobstermen supported the
            move because they didn't want to see another boat like the former
            wood-powered paddlewheeler Western Lady, which had been sunk near the
            mouth of the river in 2009. In addition, they were concerned that
            the old boats would sink while tied to a buoy and could possibly
            cause a spill. The first GRIB was built at the Two Lights Marina and
            is made of steel and fiberglass. It is 275 feet long and 22 feet wide. The
            first GRIB has a water ballast tank capable of holding 5,500 gallons of
            water. It also has storage for other water supplies, including fuel and
            waste products. It has the ability to pump air in the ballast tank so
            that lobstermen can keep their traps running. The GRIB has two crew
            stations. One is in front of the pilothouse and is used to drive the
            boat. The second station is on the left side of the wheelhouse and is
            used to drive the wheels.
