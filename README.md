 # Requirements
*The website must be static
*The contents must be uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket

# Tools Used
This webste used AWS CloudFront to publish. Right now I get an account verification error, so that part is not done yet. Used AWS S3 bucket to store all of the files used.
I don't have much experience making websites. However, learning how to use AWS services helped a lot.
